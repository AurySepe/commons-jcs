Yet Another Java Cache 
----------------------
Currently a jdk1.5 soft reference memory-only cache with:

* zero configuration
* zero thread instantiation
* minimal memory impact (controlled by GC via SoftReference)
* no sychronized block
* no synchronized method
* the cache instance itself (ICache) can be used anywhere a map
instance can be used
* optional ICacheSafe to provide thread-safe cache get/put via either
Serializable or Java Bean patterns
* Intelligent guess to avoid deep clone whenever possible when
ICacheSafe is used
* String-only key constraint to avoid mutability issues
* Fully parameterized cache value type
* Full set of junit test cases, including emulation of hard-to-test
data race conditions

Pre-requisite
-------------
1) jdk 1.5.0_01+ installed
1) Ant 1.6.2+ installed
2) copy lib/junit-3.8.1.jar to your <ANT_HOME>/lib/

Build
-----
Simply type:

ant

Alternatively, if you've got NetBeans 4.0, life is even easier.
Simply open up the "cache" project folder, and build it.
