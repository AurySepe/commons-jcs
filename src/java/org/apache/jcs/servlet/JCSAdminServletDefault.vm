<h1> Cache Regions </h1>

<p>These are the regions which are currently defined in the cache. 'Items' and
'Bytes' refer to the elements currently in memory (not spooled). You can clear
all items for a region by selecting 'Remove all' next to the desired region
below. You can also <a href="?action=clearAllRegions">Clear all regions</a>
which empties the entire cache.</p>
